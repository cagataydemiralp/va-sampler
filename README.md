Variational Autoencoder Viewer  
============================== 
This is a basic AE visualizer that I've created to support the discussion of
the paper at our reading group. It may help others reading the paper as well.
The autoencoder implementation is based on Keras.

You can play with the live app or download, build and experiment 
with it, which I suggest. The live app uses a free, low power compute 
server for autoencoder computations. So, you may experience some lag with 
the grid visualizations.   

To install, download or clone the repo and then run `npm install` in 
the va-viewer folder.
